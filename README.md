# ACNH-Villagers

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.
A web application for Animal Crossing players who want to view and save their favorite characters(villagers)

## Why I Built This

As a player of the game Animal Crossing New Horizons, I wanted to build an application where fans of the game could view the characters of the game and gain more information about each character. Since there are almost 400 different villagers, I also wanted to make an application where players of the game could pick and save their favorite villagers.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript(ES5)
- ACNH API
  - documentation: http://acnhapi.com/doc

- User can search for villagers using type of animal (and not only name)
